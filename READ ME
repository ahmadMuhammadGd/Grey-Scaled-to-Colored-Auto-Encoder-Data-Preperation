WHAT IS IT:
An easy way to convert bulky images to greyscale at once, without any changes in its' name or dimentions.
The code is created to make training data for my ANN to convert greyscale images to colored images.

HOW TO USE IT:
import tools.py then call convertAllImagesInFolder(source_dir, dist_dir) function
make sure that the letter 'r' is written before directories, for example:
import tools
tools.convertAllImagesInFolder(r'G:\source pictures', r'G:\greyscaled')
