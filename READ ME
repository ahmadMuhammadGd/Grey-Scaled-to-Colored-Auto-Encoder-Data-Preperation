WHAT IS IT:
An easy way to convert bulky images to greyscale at once, without any changes in its' name or dimentions.
The code is created to make training data for my ANN to convert greyscale images to colored images.

HOW TO USE IT:
import tools.py then simply call convertAllImagesInFolder(source_dir, dist_dir) function
if directories are passed directly to convertAllImagesInFolder(source_dir, dist_dir), make sure that letter 'r' is written before directories, for example:
==>
import tools
tools.convertAllImagesInFolder(r'G:\source pictures', r'G:\greyscaled')

if directories are stored in variables, directly pass the variables:
==>
import tools
source = 'G:\ANN\source pictures'
dist = 'G:\ANN\greyscaled'
tools.convertAllImagesInFolder(source, dist)
